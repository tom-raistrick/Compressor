# Compressor
A high quality VCA-based dynamic range compressor that offers control over attack, release, threshold, gain reduction, and output level.  Additionally, two columns of 10 LEDs provide metering of gain reduction level and output level, with a separate LED indicating whether the current audio input level exceeds the chosen threshold.  All LEDs are switched and can be turned off to aid objective listening, and the audio path can be bypassed to compare processed and unprocessed audio.
